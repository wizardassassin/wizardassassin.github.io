    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <p>This website is about some random coding things I do.<br>It's kind of like a testing area for me to learn about
        HTML and JavaScript.<br>The first thing I did was make a minion profit calculator for Hypixel Skyblock(An
        unorthodox approach on the concept of skyblock in Minecraft).<br>Hypixel Skyblock is an very in depth game, but
        this program just focuses on the minion portion of the game.<br>Minions are little workers that mine
        resources(free of charge-with an initial cost)for
        the player.<br>The player can then sell the resources for profit(coins).<br>The price of resources changes over
        time, hence the need for a program to calculate the profit of the resources a minion will make.<br>The table
        calculates the profit for
        each of the minion's tiers.<br>Each tier is assumed to have diamond spreading and hyper catalysts.<br>The last
        row has the minion with the most profit listed for each tier.<br>The console on the main page lists the parsed
        data the table works with.<br>The console can be accessed by pressing Crtl+Shift+j on Windows or Ctrl+Option+J
        on Mac.<br>If you run into any bugs, please let me know at my <a
